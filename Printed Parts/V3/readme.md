## Notices
V3 has been printed. Sizing and hinges seem to work well, however filament model was printed with was faulty and model disintegrated before hardware could be attached.

## Future iteration plans

    -Decrease size
    -Decrease print time
    -Increase Hinge Strength with embedded structures forcing Cura to create walls inside the print while allowing overall infill density to remain at or below 20%

## Printing Notes

    - Recommend a wall thickness of at least 1.6mm 
    - Infill: 20% gyroid
    - Orientation: On the models side, text down.
