# SneksMagnetCuff


The primary goals of the SMC project is developing a electric bondage cuff which lends itself particularly well to self bondage or a partner who is bad at tying knots. It also will be very simple, requires very little tools, time, or maker expereince invested in order to get a quality easy to use device for your kinky needs. 

**Principles of design**:
1. 3D printable in as few pieces as feasable on an Ender 3 or bigger.
2. Minimum number of tools needed to assemble.
4. Short and inexpensive BOM list.
4. Quickly go from computer screen to device in your hand.

Please understand this is very much a work in progress, I am still a novice at fusion360, and this device could help put you in a difficult situation if you fail to plan out your scene appropriatly. 


## Bill Of Materials

1) **3D Printed Parts**
   - As of now there is only 3D printed frame to print [this one](https://github.com/Snekinthegrass/SneksMagnetCuff/tree/main/Printed%20Parts/V3)
   - In the future I would like to work on making a version that accepts inserts of different sizes to accommodate different size wrists.
2) **60kg Electromagnetic Door Lock** : [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JERC00S?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_Y2GZASBTFSPPE06WMASH)
    - There are a few of these on amazon and I imagine they all come from the same alibaba/aliexpress supplier. I used the one I linked but they all seem to have the same dimensions, I'd double chek they match or alternatively be willing to make changes to the design before buying a different one. 
4) **12v Power Supply** : [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077PW5JC3?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
   - A 12v power supply according to the magnet description they only require .15Amps so you probably already have a wall wart laying around thats more than    up to the job.
5) **DC Male/Female Pigtail Connectors** : [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PS8T2KM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
   -Just one of any number of convenient electrical connectors you can use with this magnet.
7) **Random Electrical bits/bobs** : 
   -Wires, Switches, Smart-Plugs, go nuts whatever your heart desires.
8) **Random Screws** : 
   -I used wood screws long enough to mount the *SMC* on a 2x4 
   
## Tips 

1) Ensure your printer is tuned at least decently well so the print in place hinge works 
  -It might take some force to break the hinge loose the first time off the printer, when I printed it out the first time in PLA I had to step on it with my whole body weight before it broke loose, the hinge didn't seem to mind so its probably more than strong enough. 
  
2) Leave the magnet armature just slightly loose so it can self align to the electromagnet 

3) If you use this for self bondage I highly recommend redundency in cutting power (i.e)
  -Smartplug plugged into mechanical timer so if one fails the other timer will still cut power
  -Using a battery powered setup to limit the max time its possible for the device to keep you locked up, if you go this route be sure to check the current,    since these magnets pull so little current you could in theory accidently lock yourself in for many many hours waiting for the batteries to die.
  -Somebody you trust who can come let you out and who you don't mind seeing you in a rather vulnerable position.
